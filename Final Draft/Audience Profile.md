### Modern-day college students find themselves in a perilous place. With the cost of education rising faster than ever, the prices of textbooks skyrocketing, and the usual stressors that come from being a college student piling on, many students in the modern-day cannot afford to spend more than what is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, for college students, there are often extra costs that come with classes such as online access codes, subscriptions to software, honor societies, and more. With this in mind, some college students really need to penny pinch. The students that fit this descriptor probably cannot afford to spend money on extras like a Microsoft Office package (if their schools do not provide one for them). 
### These students are the intended audience for the attached documentation manual which details the capabilities of and benefits of using a free, open-source Office suite: LibreOffice. This Office suite provides programs very similar in functionality and capabilities as popular Office suites like Microsoft Word. The program package provides a word processor, spreadsheet program, calculus software, presentation package, art editor, and statistics platform. Students could rely on this software to serve them during a college writing course due to its accessibility and ease-of-use. 

### The limitations associated with this documentation are that it does not take into account the familiarity of LibreOffice or other open-source software. Therefore, this information can only serve those searching for, interested in, or aware of open-source software.
