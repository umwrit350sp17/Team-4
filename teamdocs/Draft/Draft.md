#  **PROJECT OUTLINE**

## **Introduction**

### **Purpose**
To create an informative outline targeted at first-year college students that will aim to explain how to use _LibreOffice_ in a _Microsoft Office_ dominated university, with an emphasis on Microsoft Office compatibility and overall usefulness in 100-level writing courses.

### **Audience**
College students enrolled in a first-year writing seminar in which open-source software, such as _LibreOffice’s_ **Writer**, can be used to serve as a student’s primary word processing application.

# **Beginning of Draft Content**

## **What is LibreOffice?**

### **Who was it created by?**
__LibreOffice__ is a continuation and reoptimization of the Apache OpenOffice open-source word processing platform by __The Document Foundation__. __The Document Foundation__ is a non-profit organization that promotes open-source document handling software. The __LibreOffice__ suite comprises programs for word processing, the creation and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in over 110 languages.

### **When was it created?**
The initial release date for __LibreOffice__ was January 25th, 2011. Forked from [OpenSource.org](https://opensource.org/) in 2010. 

### **Why was it created?** (purpose)
__LibreOffice__ was created so that free and open-source software could continue to serve those in place of popular word-processors. Created also for individuals needing an alternative to __Microsoft Office__, as __LibreOffice__ is extremely similar to __Microsoft Office__. 

## ***How to download LibreOffice***
[**Google search**](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=LibreOffice+Download) or 
[**Visit the LibreOffice website**](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)

## **Basic Tools in __LibreOffice__**

### **Home Page** (Elaborate on what each tab offers)

#### **Open File**
This tab functions in the same way that opening a file in any program works. Specifically, with _LibreOffice_, the package can open most _Microsoft Word_ documents and spreadsheets.

#### **Remote Files**
This service allows a _LibreOffice_ user to upload his/her file to a remote server or cloud-based storage site (such as _Google Drive_ or _Dropbox_) so that it can be worked on from different locations and from different computers.

#### **Recent Files**
This tab shows several of the most recent documents opened within a _LibreOffice_ program. 

### **Templates**

#### **Writer Document**
This is similar to a _Microsoft Word_ document; however, _LibreOffice_ does not save documents in the same format that _Microsoft Word_ does **(.docx)**. Instead, **_LibreOffice_ utilizes the _Open Document_ File (.odf)** to save documents. _LibreOffice_ also has similar text-editing tools to _Microsoft Word_ and a variety of other options for modifying a document, such as formatting options, text and design styles, the ability to create and insert tables, spell checking software, word count, and other tools that would be expected within a word-processor. Has extensive WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) word processing capabilities.

#### **Calc Spreadsheet**
This spreadsheet application serves as an open-source alternative to programs like _Microsoft Excel_ and _Google Sheets_. The program is similar to _Excel 07_, in terms of features and design.

#### **Impress Presentation**
This is the _LibreOffice_ version of _Microsoft Powerpoint_ or other similar presentation software. This program allows for users to create and add templates, insert images, add animations, and manage other visual design effects within the presentation. **Presentations are exported as SWF files**, which allow any computer with _Adobe Flash Player_ to view the file. 

#### **Draw Drawing**
Similar to _Microsoft Visio_. This is **a vector graphics editor and diagramming tool** that is compatible to _CorelDRAW_. This aspect of _LibreOffice_ is not applicable to the chosen project. 

#### **Math Formula**
Application designed for the user to create and edit mathematical formulas. This aspect of _LibreOffice_ is not applicable to the chosen project. 

#### **Base Database**
Allows the user to create and manage databases and reports that provides the user easy access to data. Very similar to _Microsoft Access_. This aspect of _LibreOffice_ is not applicable to the chosen project.
