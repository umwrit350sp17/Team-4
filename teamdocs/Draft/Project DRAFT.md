PROJECT OUTLINE
Introduction
Purpose
To create an informative outline targeted at first-year college students that will aim to explain how to use LibreOffice  in a Microsoft Office dominated university, with an emphasis on Microsoft Office compatibility and overall usefulness in 100-level writing courses. 
Audience
College students enrolled in a first-year writing seminar in which open-source software, such as LibreOffice’s Writer, can be used to serve as a student’s primary word processing application.

What is LibreOffice
Who was it created by?
LibreOffice is a continuation and reoptimization of the Apache OpenOffice open-source word processing platform by The Document Foundation. The Document Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes open-source document handling software. The LibreOffice suite comprises programs for word processing, the creation and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in over 110 languages.
When was it created?
The initial release date for LibreOffice was January 25th, 2011. Forked from OpenSource.org in 2010. 
Why was it created? (purpose)
LibreOffice was created so that free and open-source software could continue to serve those in place of popular word-processors. Created also for individuals that can not afford Microsoft Office, as LibreOffice is extremely similar to Microsoft Office. 
How do download LibreOffice

Basic Tools in LibreOffice
Home Page (Elaborate on what each tab offers)
Open File
This tab functions in the same way that opening a file in any program works. Specifically, with LibreOffice, the package can open most Microsoft Word documents and spreadsheets. 
Remote Files
This service allows a LibreOffice user to upload his/her file to a remote server or cloud-based storage site (such as Google Drive or Dropbox) so that it can be worked on in different locations and by different computers. 
Recent Files
This tab shows several of the most recent documents opened within a LibreOffice program. 
Templates
CREATE (What is each option? What would you compare them to?)
Writer Document
This is similar to a Microsoft Word document; however, LibreOffice does not save documents in the same format that Microsoft Word does (.docx). Instead, LibreOffice utilizes the Open Document File (.odf) to save documents. LibreOffice also has similar text-editing tools to Microsoft Word and a variety of other options for modifying a document, such as formatting options, text and design styles, the ability to create and insert tables, spell checking software, word count, and other tools that would be expected within a word-processor. Has extensive WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) word processing capabilities. 
Calc Spreadsheet
This spreadsheet application serves as an open-source alternative to programs like Excel and Google Sheets. The program is similar to Excel 07, in terms of features and design.
Impress Presentation
This is the open-source version of Powerpoint or other similar presentation software. This program allows for users to create and add templates, insert images, add animations, and manage other visual design effects within the presentation. Presentations are exported as SWF files, which allow any computer with Adobe Flash Player to view the file. 
Draw Drawing
Similar to Microsoft Visio
A vector graphics editor and diagramming tool that is compatible to CorelDRAW
