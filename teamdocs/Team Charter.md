TEAM CHARTER

Team Purpose
To explain how an open source software can be used to replace a normal software.

Time Commitment
We are to work together for about a month. 
Mainly using the group chat app “Slack” as our means of communication.

Desired End Result
We, as a team, will prove that is it easier and better to use open source software rather than a closed source software. 
We plan to create an informative outline targeted at first-year college students that will aim to explain how to use LibreOffice in a Microsoft Office dominated university, with an emphasis on Microsoft Office compatibility and overall usefulness in 100-level writing courses.

Reporting Plan
Weekly progress reports are created to allow the teacher and members know if we are on track
